If you opt for the monthly premium frequency, we may collect premiums for three months in advance on the date of commencement
of policy, as a prerequisite to allow monthly mode of premium payment.
For non annual modes, premiums paid are calculated as the annual premium multiplied by a conversion factor as given below.

<h2> What if I don't pay premium? </h2>
<p> <h3>
Grace Period is the time provided after the premium due date during which the policy is considered to be in-force with the risk
cover. This plan has a grace period of 30 days for yearly, half yearly and quarterly frequencies from the premium due date. The
grace period for monthly frequency is 15 days from the premium due date.
Should a valid claim arise under the policy during the grace period, but before the payment of due premium, we shall still honor
the claim. In such cases, the due and unpaid premium will be deducted from any benefit payable.
In case you do not pay premiums before the end of grace period, the policy will lapse. All risk cover will cease and no benefits will
be payable in case of lapsed policies.
Upon premium discontinuance, if surrender value is not acquired then the policy lapses without any value.
Upon premium discontinuance, if the policy has acquired surrender value, Death Benefit will be as follows.
 10 times of the Annualised Premium
 105% of Total Premiums Paid
 Paid Up Sum Assured
where,
Paid Up Sum Assured= (Sum Assured on Death + Additional Benefits) ×(Total Premiums Paid )/(Total Premiums Payable )
This benefit will be payable on the earlier of death and diagnosis of terminal illness.
Upon premium discontinuance, if the policy has acquired surrender value, Maturity Benefit for the ROP option will be as follows.
Paid Up Sum Assured = Guaranteed Sum Assured on Maturity ×(Total Premiums Paid )/(Total Premiums Payable ) </h3> </p>

By verifying each of the customer there is an assurance that the services like insurance, real estate and all transactions are executed in a secure manner. There is also business opportunities to our users to advertise about their property and also their contact information won’t be misused. Our project idea can be used by real estate and insurance agencies to verify their customers and provide verified services.
